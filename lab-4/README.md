## The application

For creating this app I've read the chapters that where specified in the task of the lab and also the [www.MSDN.com](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/) website for and advance look. 

For developing the project, I've used the CodeBlocks IDE. The project can be simply compiled having the ** *.cbp ** file and the resource ** *.cpp **.
